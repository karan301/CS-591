# Homework 1
_Due on June 6, 2017._

## Notes
* I added `node_modules/` to `.gitignore` so use `npm install` before testing.
* Files modified: `app.js`, `routes/assignment.js`.

## Usage
* **GET**: `localhost:3000/hw1/short` returns `{string: short, length: 5}`.
* **POST**: `localhost:3000/hw1` with url-encoded body `{key:value}` -> `{testing:short}` returns the same as above.
